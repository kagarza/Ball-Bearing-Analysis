*Description*: Given the data published by Lieblein and Zelen in 1956 and the analysis of Caroni, we will attempt to recreate a snippet of their analysis and create our own model from the same data. The data contains 210 observations of the rating life of ball bearings, the load during the test, the number of balls each bearing has, the diameter of those balls, and more. After recreating Caroni’s analysis and using a weighted least squares regression along with a backward variable selection algorithm on the regressors, we found our conclusions were similar to that of Caroni’s with one exception. Caroni found that the value for p did not vary from one company to another, but we noticed a small variation in p for company B.
